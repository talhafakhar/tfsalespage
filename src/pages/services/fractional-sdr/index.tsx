                                We focus on building optimized sales systems, not generating immediate results.
                                Typically, you&#39;ll have a complete sales framework, tested messaging, and documented
                                processes within 60-90 days. The actual results depend on your internal team&#39;s
                                execution of these systems.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our fractional team builds your sales infrastructure without the hiring costs, training
                                time, or long-term commitments. We create the systems, test the channels, and train your
                                team - then you hire internally when you&#39;re ready to scale</p>

                                No, we don&#39;t guarantee specific outcomes. We optimize and test your sales channels,
                                create proven frameworks, and build systems your internal team can execute. Your results
                                depend on consistent execution of the processes we create.

                                That&#39;s the goal! We document everything, create training materials, and provide a
                                seamless handoff to your internal team. Most clients transition to their own SDRs within
                                6-12 months with proven systems in place.

                            <p>
                                We focus on building optimized sales systems, not generating immediate results.
                                Typically, you&#39;ll have a complete sales framework, tested messaging, and documented
                                processes within 60-90 days. The actual results depend on your internal team&#39;s
                                execution of these systems.

                            <p>
                                Our fractional team builds your sales infrastructure without the hiring costs, training
                                time, or long-term commitments. We create the systems, test the channels, and train your
